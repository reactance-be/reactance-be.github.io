# High-End Transformer Engineering Consultancy Website

## Overview
A premium, minimalist B2B website for a transformer engineering consultancy with a "German engineering precision" aesthetic — blueprint-inspired grid layouts, thin lines, and sophisticated typography.

---

## Visual Design System
- **Background:** Clean white with subtle blueprint-grid patterns
- **Text:** Deep slate/navy palette
- **Accent:** Electric Blue for interactive elements (buttons, hover states, divider lines)
- **Typography:** Inter — bold headlines, clean body text, strong hierarchy
- **Layout:** Grid-based with thin separator lines evoking technical drawings
- **Animations:** Subtle fade-in on scroll, smooth section transitions
